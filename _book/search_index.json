Here are some examples of Javascript interactivity from Facebook:\n\nThe application displays more comments when I click on the 'Comments' link\nThe color of the 'Like' icon changes and the text abobe reads when 'You and ... others' when I click the 'Like' Icon\nThe list of comments change when I click 'Top Comments' or 'Most Recent'.\n\n\nJavascript has grown in popularity and developers now use the language on the client-side (for user-interface logic) and on the server-side (for business/database logic).\nIn the modules for this section, we are going to practice and re-practice the basics of the language. Finally, in the next section, we will see how to use Javascript to make a webpage respond to user actions.\nLearning Objectives\nThe goal of this module is to develop familiarity with basic Javascript syntax and programming logic.\n\nJS Basic Syntax\nconsole.log()\ndata types\nStrings\nNumbers\nBooleans\nnull\n\n\nvariable declarations (let, const)\ncombining strings\nsimple math operations\n\n\n\n\nJS Control Flow\nHow to make different blocks of code run with if()...else... statements\nComparators: >, , === , !==\nLogical Operators: && + || to evaluate the truth/falsity of multiple assertions.\nadding extra conditions with else if(...)\n\n\n\nAssignment\nComplete\n\nCodeacademy: Introduction To JavaScript\nCodeacademy: Variables\nCodeacademy: Introduction to Control Flow (if-else)\n\nThis module should take about 7 - 10 hours to complete.\nNOTE: You will need to register a free account with codeacademy.
