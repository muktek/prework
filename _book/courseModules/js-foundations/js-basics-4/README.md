# JS Basics - Part 3

## Overview

This module focuses on Javascript **arrays** and **loops**. A array is a way to create an ordered list of items in Javascript. A loop is an operation we can perform to execute a block of code x number of times. Arrays and loops are complementary because in most programs/applications, you will have a list of items and you will want to do something for each item in the list.
