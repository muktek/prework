# Muktek Prework

### Welcome!

Welcome to Muktek! You are about to begin what we hope is a life changing experience, both professionally and personally. The 13-week program will be very challenging and it is important that you prepare beforehand.

### About the Prework

Prework is material that ensures you have the basic foundation required for the course. Starting your learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that you need to train. This prework is training for your brain.
