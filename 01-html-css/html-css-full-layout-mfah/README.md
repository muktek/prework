# CSS Intermediate - Creating Full Page Responsive Layouts

## Description
The Museum of Fine Arts Houston wants to create a static webpage that shows their architectural history and future projects.  

They have provided us with the copy as well as the images and logos. We will need to create a site that places that content on the page with the styles and layout that are shown in the mockups below.

<hr>
## Objectives
Create a site that has a multi-column layout.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to create a multi-column layout in HTML and CSS and a faithful representation of a design.

## Performance Objectives

You should:
- use the inline-block technique for making the columns
- use fluid widths (%) on columns so that they dynamically adjust to screen width
- be mindful of margin and padding and when/where to use them
- be mindful of typography

## Deliverables
- an `index.html` file with the content
- a `style.css` file with the styles
- a Github repository and a live static site on Github Pages.

<hr/>
## Setup
1. In `~/TIY/assignments`, create a directory for this assignment (e.g. `assignment-05`).
2. `cd` into the new assignment directory and create your project files & folders:
  - `index.html`
  - `css/`
    - `style.css`
3. Download the images and unzip:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-Charleston-Front-End-Engineering/Course-Guide/master/assignments/layout-html-css-mfah/image-files.zip > image-files.zip
unzip image-files.zip
```

<hr/>

## Normal Mode
Create a site based on the mockup as shown below.

### The full-screen layout

##Adventurer Mode
Use media-queries to create a responsive site. The site should be one column on mobile screens (i.e. screen widths < 768px), and it should maintain the original layout on screen widths > 768px.

Also note that the search box at the bottom right becomes hidden on < 768px.
