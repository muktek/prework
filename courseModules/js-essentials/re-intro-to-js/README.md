# JS Essentials - Re-Introduction to JS

## Overview

This section is primarily focused reenforcing and expanding your understanding of the fundamentals of Javascript. We are recommending that you work through this excellent video-course:

**[Javascript Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-essentials/)** | Udemy

A small proportion of the information in this video-course is review, but there is a lot of new information and many of explanations of core language concepts are deeper than the demos on codeacademy.

Our goal in this *Javascript Essentials*  section is to provide you with a deeper knowledge of the fundamentals of the language and help you form an understanding of general programming. When you truly understand the language fundamentals, you will increase your problem solving abilities, you will understand the tools you use, and you will have greater longevity as a developer.
