# Growth Mindset and Persistence

## Growth Mindset

Having a **growth mindset** is a critical characteristic for developers who wish to have long-term success. We have selected an article for you to read that describes the growth mindset.

## Persistence

Another important trait is **persistence**.  

In this course and in your career path, there will be times where you will be tempted to give up and quit. However, if you want to become a highly skilled developer -- or a highly skilled anything -- you must resist this instinct and continue to practice and improve over a long period of time.  We have assigned a short documentary, *The Long Game* that examines how virtuosos are not 'naturally gifted' and often take years to master their craft.
