# HTML Basics - Recreate Flier into HTML

## Context
The Museum of Fine Arts Houston wants to build a static webpage to promote their Rothko exposition.  They currently have a flier designed by a graphic artist and they would like to design the site with a similar layout. 

They have provided us with the copy as well as the images and logos, and we will need to place that content on the page 
For now, we don't need to worry too much about styling; we just want to get the content on the page.

## The Assignment
Create the html for the flier shown below using appropriate `<h>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<a>` and `<div>` tags.

All of your work and markup should be created in an `index.html` file inside of a folder called `assignment-01`, and make sure that you are using the HTML5 standard (with `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top of the file).
