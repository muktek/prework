# JS Basics

## Overview

The front-end of the web is composed of three languages:

+ HTML  : Structure & Content
+ + CSS : Styles
+ + **JavaScript : Behavior/Interactivity**

This module focuses on Javascript, the language used for making webpages interactive. For example, when you click a button to '+ See More Comments' and new comments appear on the page, you have used Javascript.

Javascript has grown in popularity and developers now use the language on the client-side (for user-interface logic) and on the server-side (for business/database logic).

In the modules for this section, we are going to practice and re-practice the basics of the language. Finally, in the next module, we will see how to use Javascript to make a webpage respond to user actions.
